# Suicide-and-Self-Inflicted-Injury-Rates-in-Post-Soviet-Countries-1968---2021
# Summary 
Chosen data containts information about suicide and self inflicted death count in females and males.
# Data Collection Method 
The data in the databases is collected by WHO Europe in collaboration with the Member States in the WHO European region, and from other relevant international data sources. 
# Limitations of the data set
•	Data completeness: Both the original WDI dataset and the final merged ones contain variables that are missing for some years and some countries.
•	Collection bias (varying methods): The data included covers a long time horizon and comes from many different original sources meaning the ways of measuring and collecting data may differ across time and region. 
•	Collection bias (politically motivated): The data collected comes from government entities which have their own political agendas which may result in bias in certain regions and time horizons. 
•	Collection bias (self-reporting): Likely some of the data comes from survey collection and it's possible that surveys were self-selecting for certain types of respondents or that respondents may have felt political, economic or societal pressure to answer in a certain manner.
